      <p outputclass="recommendation">Do not take indigestion remedies 2 hours before or after you take this medicine</p>
      <p outputclass="labelDescription">To be used with label 25 on <i>preparations coated to resist gastric acid</i> (e.g. enteric-coated tablets). This is to avoid the possibility of premature dissolution of the coating in the presence of an alkaline pH. Label 5 also applies to drugs such as gabapentin <i>where the absorption is significantly affected by antacids</i>. Pharmacists will be aware (from a knowledge of physiology) that the usual time during which indigestion remedies should be avoided is at least 2 hours before and after the majority of medicines have been taken; when a manufacturer advises a different time period, this can be followed, and should be explained to the patient.</p>

        <p>Active immunity can be acquired by natural disease or by vaccination. <b>Vaccines</b> stimulate production of antibodies and other components of the immune mechanism; they consist of either:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>a <i>live attenuated</i> form of a virus (e.g. measles, mumps and rubella vaccine) or bacteria (e.g. BCG vaccine), or</li>
          <li>
            <i>inactivated</i> preparations of the virus (e.g. influenza vaccine) or bacteria, or</li>

          <li>
            <i>extracts of</i> a micro-organism, which may be derived from the organism (e.g. pneumococcal vaccine) or produced by recombinant DNA technology (e.g. hepatitis B vaccine).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          <b>Live attenuated</b>

        <p>
          <b>Inactivated vaccines</b> may require a primary series of injections of vaccine to produce an adequate antibody response, and in most cases booster (reinforcing) injections are required; the duration of immunity varies from months to many years.

        <p>Vaccines for the childhood immunisation schedule should be obtained from <b>local health organisations</b> or <b>from ImmForm</b> (<xref format="html" href="https://www.immform.dh.gov.uk">www.immform.dh.gov.uk</xref>)—not to be prescribed on FP10 (HS21 in Northern Ireland; GP10 in Scotland; WP10 in Wales).</p>

          <p outputclass="title">Preterm birth</p>
          <p>Babies born preterm should receive all routine immunisations based on their actual date of birth. The risk of apnoea following vaccination is increased in preterm babies, particularly in those born at or before 28 weeks gestational age. If babies at risk of apnoea are in hospital at the time of their first immunisation, they should be monitored for 48 hours after immunisation. If a baby develops apnoea, bradycardia, or desaturation after the first immunisation, the second immunisation should also be given in hospital with similar monitoring. Seroconversion may be unreliable in babies born earlier than 28 weeks’ gestation or in babies treated with corticosteroids for chronic lung disease; consideration should be given to testing for antibodies against <i>Haemophilus influenzae</i> type b, meningococcal C, and hepatitis B after primary immunisation.</p>

        <p>Diphtheria-containing vaccines are prepared from the toxin of <ph outputclass="organism"><i><i>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</i></i></ph> and adsorption on aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate improves antigenicity. The vaccine stimulates the production of the protective antibody. The quantity of diphtheria toxoid in a preparation determines whether the vaccine is defined as ‘high dose’ or ‘low dose’. Vaccines containing the higher dose of diphtheria toxoid are used for primary immunisation of children under 10 years of age. Vaccines containing the lower dose of diphtheria toxoid are used for primary immunisation in adults and children over 10 years. Single-antigen diphtheria vaccine is not available and adsorbed diphtheria vaccine is given as a combination product containing other vaccines.</p>
        <p>For primary immunisation <i>of children aged between 2 months and 10 years</i> vaccination is recommended usually in the form of 3 doses (separated by 1-month intervals) of <b>diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component), poliomyelitis (inactivated) and haemophilus type b conjugate vaccine (adsorbed)</b> (see Immunisation schedule). In unimmunised individuals aged <i>over 10 years</i> the primary course comprises of 3 doses of <b>adsorbed diphtheria</b> [low dose], <b>tetanus and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine</b>.</p>
        <p>A booster dose should be given 3 years after the primary course (this interval can be reduced to a minimum of 1 year if the primary course was delayed).

Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine immunisation is given in combination with diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (acellular, component) and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine, as a component of the primary course of childhood immunisation (see Immunisation schedule). For infants under 1 year, the course consists of 3 doses of a vaccine containing <ph outputclass="organism"><i><i>Haemophilus influenzae</i></i></ph> type b component with an interval of 1 month between doses. A booster dose of haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (combined with meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine) should be given at 12–13 months of age.</p>
        <p>Children 1–10 years who have not been immunised against <ph outputclass="organism"><i><i>Haemophilus influenzae</i></i></ph> type b need to receive only 1 dose of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (combined with meningococcal group C conjugate vaccine).

        <p>Different immunisation schedules for <xref format="dita" href="PHP8310.xml" type="drug">hepatitis B vaccine</xref> are recommended for specific circumstances.

        <p>Immunisation may take up to 6 months to confer adequate protection; the duration of immunity is not known precisely, but a single booster 5 years after the primary course may be sufficient to maintain immunity for those who continue to be at risk.</p>
        <p>Immunisation does not eliminate the need for commonsense precautions for avoiding the risk of infection from known carriers by the routes of infection which have been clearly established, consult <i>Guidance for Clinical Health Care Workers: Protection against Infection with Blood-borne Viruses</i> (available at <xref format="html" href="http://www.dh.gov.uk">www.dh.gov.uk</xref>). Accidental inoculation of hepatitis B virus-infected blood into a wound, incision, needle-prick, or abrasion may lead to infection, whereas it is unlikely that indirect exposure to a carrier will do so.</p>
        <p>Following significant exposure to hepatitis B, an accelerated schedule, with the second dose given 1 month, and the third dose 2 months after the first dose, is recommended. For those at continued risk, a fourth dose should be given 12 months after the first dose. More detailed guidance is given in the handbook <i>Immunisation against Infectious Disease</i>.

        <p>Human papillomavirus vaccine is available as a bivalent vaccine (<i>Cervarix</i><tm tmtype="reg" />) or a quadrivalent vaccine (<i>Gardasil </i><tm tmtype="reg" />). <i>Cervarix</i><tm tmtype="reg" /> is licensed for use in females for the prevention of cervical cancer and other pre-cancerous lesions caused by human papillomavirus types 16 and 18. <i>Gardasil </i><tm tmtype="reg" /> is licensed for use in females for the prevention of cervical and anal cancers, genital warts and pre-cancerous genital (cervical, vulvar, and vaginal) and anal lesions caused by human papillomavirus types 6, 11, 16, and 18. The vaccines may also provide limited protection against disease caused by other types of human papillomavirus. The two vaccines are not interchangeable and one vaccine product should be used for an entire course.</p>
        <p>Human papillomavirus vaccine will be most effective if given before sexual activity starts. From September 2014, a 2-dose schedule is recommended, as long as the first dose is received before the age of 15 years. The first dose is given to females aged 11 to 14 years, and the second dose is given 6–24 months after the first dose (for the purposes of planning the national immunisation programme, it is appropriate to give the second dose 12 months after the first (see Immunisation schedule). If the course is interrupted, it should be resumed (using the same vaccine) but not repeated, even if more than 24 months have elapsed since the first dose or if the girl is then aged 15 years or more. Females receiving their first dose aged 15 years or older require a 3-dose schedule (see <i>Cervarix</i><tm tmtype="reg" /> and <i>Gardasil</i><tm tmtype="reg" />), with the second and third doses given 1 and 4–6 months after the first dose; all 3 doses should be given within a 12-month period. If the course is interrupted, it should be resumed (using the same vaccine) but not repeated, allowing the appropriate interval between the remaining doses. If a 3-dose course of vaccination has been started before September 2014, then where possible this should be completed; if the course is interrupted, it should be resumed (using the same vaccine) but not repeated, allowing the appropriate interval between the remaining doses. Under the national programme in England, females remain eligible to receive the human papillomavirus vaccine up to the age of 18 years if they did not receive the vaccine when scheduled. Where appropriate, immunisation with human papillomavirus vaccine should be offered to females coming into the UK as they may not have been offered protection in their country of origin. The duration of protection has not been established, but current studies suggest that protection is maintained for at least 6 years after completion of the primary course.</p>
        <p>As the vaccines do not protect against all strains of human papillomavirus, routine cervical screening should continue.</p>

Further booster doses are only necessary for adults at special risk, such as travellers to endemic areas, or laboratory staff likely to be exposed to the viruses, or healthcare workers in possible contact with cases; booster doses should be given to such individuals every 10 years.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Live (oral) poliomyelitis vaccine</b> is no longer available for routine use; its use may be considered during large outbreaks, but advice should be sought from Public Health England. The live (oral) vaccine poses a very rare risk of vaccine-associated paralytic polio because the attenuated strain of the virus can revert to a virulent form.

Transmission of rabies by humans has not been recorded but it is advised that those caring for patients with the disease should be vaccinated.</p>
          <p>Immunisation against rabies is also recommended where there is limited access to prompt medical care for those living in areas where rabies is enzootic, for those travelling to such areas for longer than 1 month, and for those on shorter visits who may be exposed to unusual risk.</p>
          <p>Immunisation against rabies is indicated during pregnancy if there is substantial risk of exposure to rabies and rapid access to post-exposure prophylaxis is likely to be limited.</p>

          <p>Following potential exposure to rabies, the wound or site of exposure (e.g. mucous membrane) should be cleansed under running water and washed for several minutes with soapy water as soon as possible after exposure. Disinfectant and a simple dressing can be applied, but suturing should be delayed because it may increase the risk of introducing rabies virus into the nerves.</p>
          <p>Post-exposure prophylaxis against rabies depends on the level of risk in the country, the nature of exposure, and the individual’s immunity. In each case, expert risk assessment and advice on appropriate management should be obtained from the local Public Health England Centre or Public Health England’s Virus Reference Department, Colindale (tel. (020) 8200 4400) or the PHE Colindale Duty Doctor (tel. (020) 8200 6868), in Wales from the Public Health Wales local Health Protection Team or Public Health Wales Virus Reference Laboratory (tel.

          <p>There are no specific contra-indications to the use of <xref format="dita" href="PHP8391.xml" type="drug">rabies vaccine</xref> for post-exposure prophylaxis and its use should be considered whenever a patient has been attacked by an animal in a country where rabies is enzootic, even if there is no direct evidence of rabies in the attacking animal. Because of the potential consequences of untreated rabies exposure and because rabies vaccination has not been associated with fetal abnormalities, pregnancy is not considered a contraindication to post-exposure prophylaxis.</p>
          <p>For post-exposure prophylaxis of <i>fully immunised</i> individuals (who have previously received pre-exposure or post-exposure prophylaxis with cell-derived rabies vaccine), 2 doses of cell-derived vaccine are likely to be sufficient; the first dose is given on day 0 and the second dose is given between day 3–7. <xref format="dita" href="PHP8470.xml" type="drug">Rabies immunoglobulin</xref> is not necessary in such cases.</p>

        <p outputclass="title">Tetanus vaccine</p>
        <p>
          <b>Tetanus vaccine</b> contains a cell-free purified toxin of <ph outputclass="organism"><i><i>Clostridium tetani</i></i></ph> adsorbed on aluminium hydroxide or aluminium phosphate to improve antigenicity.</p>
        <p>Primary immunisation for children under 10 years consists of 3 doses of a combined preparation containing adsorbed tetanus vaccine, with an interval of 1 month between doses. Following routine childhood vaccination, 2 booster doses of a preparation containing adsorbed tetanus vaccine are recommended, the first before school entry and the second before leaving school (see Immunisation schedule).</p>
        <p>The recommended schedule of tetanus vaccination not only gives protection against tetanus in childhood but also gives the basic immunity for subsequent booster doses. In most circumstances, a total of 5 doses of tetanus vaccine is considered sufficient for long term protection.</p>
        <p>For primary immunisation of adults and children over 10 years previously unimmunised against tetanus, 3 doses of <b>adsorbed diphtheria [low dose], tetanus and poliomyelitis (inactivated) vaccine</b> are given with an interval of 1 month between doses (see Diphtheria-containing Vaccines).</p>
        <p>When an individual presents for a booster dose but has been vaccinated following a tetanus-prone wound, the vaccine preparation administered at the time of injury should be determined. If this is not possible, the booster should still be given to ensure adequate protection against all antigens in the booster vaccine.</p>
        <p>Very rarely, tetanus has developed after abdominal surgery; patients awaiting elective surgery should be asked about tetanus immunisation and immunised if necessary.</p>
        <p>Parenteral drug abuse is also associated with tetanus; those abusing drugs by injection should be vaccinated if unimmunised—booster doses should be given if there is any doubt about their immunisation status.</p>
        <p>All laboratory staff should be offered a primary course if unimmunised.</p>
        <sectiondiv>
          <p outputclass="title">Wounds</p>
          <p>Wounds are considered to be tetanus-prone if they are sustained more than 6 hours before surgical treatment or at any interval after injury and are puncture-type (particularly if contaminated with soil or manure) <i>or</i> show much devitalised tissue <i>or</i> are septic <i>or</i> are compound fractures <i>or</i> contain foreign bodies. All wounds should receive thorough cleansing.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>For <i>clean wounds</i>: fully immunised individuals (those who have received a total of 5 doses of a tetanus-containing vaccine at appropriate intervals) and those whose primary immunisation is complete (with boosters up to date), do not require tetanus vaccine; individuals whose primary immunisation is incomplete or whose boosters are not up to date require a reinforcing dose of a tetanus-containing vaccine (followed by further doses as required to complete the schedule); non-immunised individuals (or those whose immunisation status is not known or who have been fully immunised but are now immunocompromised) should be given a dose of the appropriate tetanus-containing vaccine immediately (followed by completion of the full course of the vaccine if records confirm the need)</li>
            <li>For <i>tetanus-prone wounds</i>: management is as for clean wounds with the addition of a dose of tetanus immunoglobulin given at a different site; in fully immunised individuals and those whose primary immunisation is complete (with boosters up to date) the immunoglobulin is needed only if the risk of infection is especially high (e.g. contamination with manure). Antibacterial prophylaxis (with benzylpenicillin, co-amoxiclav, or metronidazole) may also be required for tetanus-prone wounds.</li>

        <p>
          <xref format="dita" href="PHP8407.xml" type="drug">Tick-borne encephalitis vaccine, inactivated</xref> contains inactivated tick-borne encephalitis virus cultivated in chick embryo cells. It is recommended for immunisation of those working in, or visiting, high-risk areas (see International Travel). Those working, walking or camping in warm forested areas of Central and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, Northern and Eastern China, and some parts of Japan, particularly from April to November when ticks are most prevalent, are at greatest risk of tick-borne encephalitis. For full protection, 3 doses of the vaccine are required; booster doses are required every 3–5 years for those still at risk. Ideally, immunisation should be completed at least one month before travel.</p>

        <p outputclass="title">Typhoid vaccine</p>
        <p>
          <xref format="dita" href="PHP8411.xml" type="drug">Typhoid vaccine</xref> is available as Vi capsular polysaccharide (from <ph outputclass="organism"><i><i>Salmonella typhi</i></i></ph>) vaccine for injection and as live attenuated <ph outputclass="organism"><i><i>Salmonella typhi</i></i></ph> for oral use.</p>
        <p>Typhoid immunisation is advised for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>travellers to areas where typhoid is endemic, especially if staying with or visiting local people;</li>
          <li>travellers to endemic areas where frequent or prolonged exposure to poor sanitation and poor food hygiene is likely</li>
          <li>laboratory personnel who, in the course of their work, may be exposed to <ph outputclass="organism"><i><i>Salmonella typhi</i></i></ph>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Typhoid vaccination is not a substitute for scrupulous personal hygiene.</p>
        <p>Capsular <b>polysaccharide</b><xref format="dita" href="PHP8411.xml" type="drug">typhoid vaccine</xref> is usually given by <i>intramuscular injection</i>. Children under 2 years may respond suboptimally to the vaccine, but children aged between 1–2 years should be immunised if the risk of typhoid fever is considered high (immunisation is not recommended for infants under 12 months). Revaccination is needed every 3 years on continued exposure.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Oral</b>
          <xref format="dita" href="PHP8411.xml" type="drug">typhoid vaccine</xref> is a <b>live attenuated </b>vaccine contained in an enteric-coated capsule. One capsule taken on alternate days for a total of 3 doses, provides protection 7–10 days after the last dose. Protection may persist for up to 3 years in those constantly (or repeatedly) exposed to <ph outputclass="organism"><i><i>Salmonella typhi</i></i></ph>, but those who only occasionally travel to endemic areas require further courses at intervals of 1 year.</p>

        <p outputclass="title">Varicella-zoster vaccine</p>
        <p>The live <xref format="dita" href="PHP8420.xml" type="drug">varicella-zoster vaccine</xref>, <i>Varilrix</i><tm tmtype="reg" /> and <i>Varivax</i><tm tmtype="reg" />, are licensed for immunisation against varicella (chickenpox) in seronegative individuals. They are not recommended for routine use in children, but can be given to seronegative healthy children over 1 year who come into close contact with individuals at high risk of severe varicella infections. The Department of Health recommends these vaccines for seronegative healthcare workers who come into direct contact with patients. Those with a history of chickenpox or shingles can be considered immune, but healthcare workers with a negative or uncertain history should be tested.</p>
        <p>Rarely, the <xref format="dita" href="PHP8420.xml" type="drug">varicella-zoster vaccine</xref> virus has been transmitted from the vaccinated individual to close contacts. Therefore, contact with the following should be avoided if a vaccine-related cutaneous rash develops within 4–6 weeks of the first or second dose:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>varicella-susceptible pregnant women;</li>
          <li>individuals at high risk of severe varicella, including those with immunodeficiency or those receiving immunosuppressive therapy;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Healthcare workers who develop a generalised papular or vesicular rash on vaccination should avoid contact with patients until the lesions have crusted. Those who develop a localised rash after vaccination should cover the lesions and be allowed to continue working unless in contact with patients at high risk of severe varicella.</p>
        <p>The high potency, live <xref format="dita" href="PHP8420.xml" type="drug">varicella-zoster vaccine</xref>, <i>Zostavax</i><tm tmtype="reg" />, is recommended for the prevention of <i>herpes zoster</i> (shingles) in adults who are, or were, 70 years of age on 1 September 2014. The 2014-15, catch-up programme with <i>Zostavax</i><tm tmtype="reg" /> will be offered to all who are, or were, 78 or 79 years of age on 1 September 2014. A single dose of <i>Zostavax</i><tm tmtype="reg" /> is likely to give protection for at least 7 years, but the need for, or timing of, a booster dose has not been established. Although <i>Zostavax</i><tm tmtype="reg" /> is not recommended for the treatment of shingles or post-herpetic neuralgia, it can be given to those with a previous history of shingles; ideally the vaccine should be delayed until systemic antiviral therapy has been completed.</p>

        <p>
          <xref format="dita" href="PHP8427.xml" type="drug">Yellow fever vaccine, live</xref> is indicated for those travelling or living in areas where infection is endemic and for laboratory staff who handle the virus or who handle clinical material from suspected cases. Infants under 6 months of age should not be vaccinated because there is a small risk of encephalitis; infants aged 6–9 months should be vaccinated only if the risk of yellow fever is high and unavoidable (seek expert advice). The immunity which probably lasts for life is officially accepted for 10 years starting from 10 days after primary immunisation and for a further 10 years immediately after revaccination.</p>
