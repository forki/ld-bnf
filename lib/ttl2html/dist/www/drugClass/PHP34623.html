              <p>The benefit of treatment with corticosteroids during pregnancy outweighs the risk. Corticosteroid cover is required during labour.</p><p>Following a review of the data on the safety of systemic corticosteroids used in pregnancy and breast-feeding the CSM (May 1998) concluded that corticosteroids vary in their ability to cross the placenta but there is no convincing evidence that systemic corticosteroids increase the incidence of congenital abnormalities such as cleft palate or lip. When administration is prolonged or repeated during pregnancy, systemic corticosteroids increase the risk of intra-uterine growth restriction; there is no evidence of intra-uterine growth restriction following short-term treatment (e.g. prophylactic treatment for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome). Any adrenal suppression in the neonate following prenatal exposure usually resolves spontaneously after birth and is rarely clinically important.</p>

                <h3>Adrenal suppression</h3>
              <p>During prolonged therapy with corticosteroids, particularly with systemic use, adrenal atrophy develops and can persist for years after stopping. Abrupt withdrawal after a prolonged period can lead to acute adrenal insufficiency, hypotension, or death.</p><p>To compensate for a diminished adrenocortical response caused by prolonged corticosteroid treatment, any significant intercurrent illness, trauma, or surgical procedure requires a temporary increase in corticosteroid dose, or if already stopped, a temporary reintroduction of corticosteroid treatment. To avoid a precipitous fall in blood pressure during anaesthesia or in the immediate postoperative period, anaesthetists <b>must</b> know whether a patient is taking or has been taking a corticosteroid. A suitable regimen for corticosteroid replacement, in patients who have taken more than 10&#8239;mg prednisolone daily (or equivalent) within 3 months of surgery, is:</p><ul>
            <li>Minor surgery under general anaesthesia&#8212;usual oral corticosteroid dose on the morning of surgery or hydrocortisone (usually the sodium succinate) intravenously at induction; the usual oral corticosteroid dose is recommenced after surgery.</li>
            <li>Moderate or major surgery&#8212;usual oral corticosteroid dose on the morning of surgery and hydrocortisone intravenously at induction, followed by hydrocortisone 3 times a day by intravenous injection for 24 hours after moderate surgery or for 48&#8211;72 hours after major surgery; the usual pre-operative oral corticosteroid dose is recommenced on stopping hydrocortisone injections.</li>
            </ul><p>Patients on long-term corticosteroid treatment should carry a steroid treatment card which gives guidance on minimising risk and provides details of prescriber, drug, dosage and duration of treatment.</p>

            <section class="advice">
                <h3>Infections</h3>
              <p>Prolonged courses of corticosteroids increase susceptibility to infections and severity of infections; clinical presentation of infections may also be atypical. Serious infections e.g. <i>septicaemia</i> and <i>tuberculosis</i> may reach an advanced stage before being recognised, and <i>amoebiasis</i> or <i>strongyloidiasis</i> may be activated or exacerbated (exclude before initiating a corticosteroid in those at risk or with suggestive symptoms). Fungal or viral <i>ocular infections</i> may also be exacerbated.</p><p outputclass="title">Chickenpox</p> <p>Unless they have had chickenpox, patients receiving oral or parenteral corticosteroids for purposes other than replacement should be regarded as being <i>at risk of severe chickenpox</i> (see Steroid Treatment Card). Manifestations of fulminant illness include pneumonia, hepatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation; rash is not necessarily a prominent feature.</p> <p>Passive immunisation with varicella&#8211;zoster immunoglobulin is needed for exposed non&#8211;immune patients receiving systemic corticosteroids or for those who have used them within the previous 3 months. Confirmed chickenpox warrants specialist care and urgent treatment. Corticosteroids should not be stopped and dosage may need to be increased.</p> <p>Topical, inhaled or rectal corticosteroids are less likely to be associated with an increased risk of severe chickenpox.</p><p outputclass="title">Measles</p> <p>Patients taking corticosteroids should be advised to take particular care to avoid exposure to measles and to seek immediate medical advice if exposure occurs. Prophylaxis with intramuscular normal immunoglobulin may be needed.</p>

                <h3>Psychiatric reactions</h3>
              <p>Systemic corticosteroids, particularly in high doses, are linked to psychiatric reactions including euphoria, nightmares, insomnia, irritability, mood lability, suicidal thoughts, psychotic reactions, and behavioural disturbances. A serious paranoid state or depression with risk of suicide can be induced, particularly in patients with a history of mental disorder. These reactions frequently subside on reducing the dose or discontinuing the corticosteroid but they may also require specific management. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if psychiatric symptoms (especially depression and suicidal thoughts) occur and they should also be alert to the rare possibility of such reactions during withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment.</p><p>Systemic corticosteroids should be prescribed with care in those predisposed to psychiatric reactions, including those who have previously suffered corticosteroid&#8211;induced psychosis, or who have a personal or family history of psychiatric disorders.</p>

                <h3>Advice for patients</h3>
              <p>Patients on long-term corticosteroid treatment should carry a Steroid Treatment Card which gives guidance on minimising risk and provides details of prescriber, drug, dosage and duration of treatment.</p><p>A patient information leaflet should be supplied to every patient when a systemic corticosteroid is prescribed. Patients should especially be advised of the following:</p><ul>
            <li>
            <b>Immunosuppression</b> Prolonged courses of corticosteroids can increase susceptibility to infection and serious infections can go unrecognised. Unless already immune, patients are at risk of severe <b>chickenpox</b> and should avoid close contact with people who have chickenpox or shingles. Similarly, precautions should also be taken against contracting <b>measles</b>;</li>
            <li>
            <b>Adrenal suppression</b> If the corticosteroid is given for longer than 3 weeks, treatment must not be stopped abruptly. Adrenal suppression can last for a year or more after stopping treatment and the patient must mention the course of corticosteroid when receiving treatment for any illness or injury;</li>
            <li>
            <b>Mood and behaviour changes</b> Corticosteroid treatment, especially with high doses, can alter mood and behaviour early in treatment&#8212;the patient can become confused, irritable and suffer from delusion and suicidal thoughts. These effects can also occur when corticosteroid treatment is being withdrawn. Medical advice should be sought if worrying psychological changes occur;</li>
            <li>
            <b>Other serious effects</b> Serious gastro-intestinal, musculoskeletal, and ophthalmic effects which require medical help can also occur.</li>

                <h3>Steroid treatment cards</h3>
              <p>Steroid treatment cards should be issued where appropriate.

Withdrawal can also be associated with fever, myalgia, arthralgia, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, painful itchy skin nodules and weight loss.</p><p>The magnitude and speed of dose reduction in corticosteroid withdrawal should be determined on a case-by&#8211;case basis, taking into consideration the underlying condition that is being treated, and individual patient factors such as the likelihood of relapse and the duration of corticosteroid treatment. <i>Gradual</i> withdrawal of systemic corticosteroids should be considered in those whose disease is unlikely to relapse and have:</p><ul>
            <li>received more than 40&#8239;mg prednisolone (or equivalent) daily for more than 1 week;</li>
