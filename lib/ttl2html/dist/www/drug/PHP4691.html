              <p>Denosumab is associated with a risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and with a risk of hypocalcaemia.</p><p>
            <b>Osteonecrosis of the jaw</b>
            </p><p>Osteonecrosis of the jaw is a well-known and common side-effect in patients receiving denosumab 120&#8239;mg for cancer. Risk factors include smoking, old age, poor oral hygiene, invasive dental procedures (including tooth extractions, dental implants, oral surgery), comorbidity (including dental disease, anaemia, coagulopathy, infection), advanced cancer, previous treatment with bisphosphonates, and concomitant treatments (including chemotherapy, anti-angiogenic biologics, corticosteroids, and radiotherapy to head and neck). The following precautions are now recommended to reduce the risk of ONJ:</p><p>Denosumab 120&#8239;mg (cancer indication)</p><ul>
            <li>A dental examination and appropriate preventative dentistry before starting treatment are now recommended for all patients</li>
            <li>Do not start denosumab in patients with a dental or jaw condition requiring surgery, or in patients who have unhealed lesions from dental or oral surgery</li>
            </ul><p>Denosumab 60&#8239;mg (osteoporosis indication)</p><ul>
            <li>Check for ONJ risk factors before starting treatment. A dental examination and appropriate preventative dentistry are now recommended for patients with risk factors</li>
            </ul><p>All patients should be given a patient reminder card and informed of the risk of ONJ. Advise patients to tell their doctor if they have any problems with their mouth or teeth before starting treatment, if they wear dentures they should make sure their dentures fit properly before starting treatment, to maintain good oral hygiene, receive routine dental check-ups during treatment, and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain, swelling, non-healing sores or discharge to a doctor and dentist. Patients should tell their doctor and dentist that they are receiving denosumab if they need dental treatment or dental surgery.</p><p>
            <b>Hypocalcaemia</b>
            </p><p>Denosumab is associated with a risk of hypocalcaemia. This risk increases with the degree of renal impairment. Hypocalcaemia usually occurs in the first weeks of denosumab treatment, but it can also occur later in treatment.</p><p>Plasma-calcium concentration monitoring is recommended for denosumab 120&#8239;mg (cancer indication):</p><ul>
            <li>before the first dose</li>
            <li>within two weeks after the initial dose</li>
            <li>if suspected symptoms of hypocalcaemia occur</li>
            <li>consider monitoring more frequently in patients with risk factors for hypocalcaemia (e.g. severe renal impairment, creatinine clearance less than 30&#8239;mL/minute)</li>
            </ul><p>Plasma-calcium concentration monitoring is recommended for denosumab 60&#8239;mg (osteoporosis indication):</p><ul>
            <li>before each dose</li>
