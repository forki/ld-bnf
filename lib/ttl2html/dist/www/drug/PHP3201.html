              <p>The use of nicotine replacement therapy in pregnancy is preferable to the continuation of smoking, but should be used only if smoking cessation without nicotine replacement fails. Intermittent therapy is preferable to patches but avoid liquorice-flavoured nicotine products. Patches are useful, however, if the patient is experiencing pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. If patches are used, they should be removed before bed.</p>

              <p>Patches should be applied on waking to dry, non-hairy skin on the hip, trunk, or upper arm and held in position for 10&#8211;20 seconds to ensure adhesion; place next patch on a different area and avoid using the same site for several days.</p>

The patient should not inhale while spraying and avoid swallowing for a few seconds after use.

The amount of nicotine from 1 puff of the cartridge is less than that from a cigarette, therefore it is necessary to inhale more often than when smoking a cigarette. A single 10&#8239;mg cartridge lasts for approximately 20 minutes of intense use; a single 15&#8239;mg cartridge lasts for approximately 40 minutes of intense use.</p>
