                <h3>Breast cancer</h3>
              <p>There is a small increase in the risk of having breast cancer diagnosed in women taking the combined oral contraceptive pill; this relative risk may be due to an earlier diagnosis. In users of combined oral contraceptive pills the cancers are more likely to be localised to the breast. The most important factor for diagnosing breast cancer appears to be the age at which the contraceptive is stopped rather than the duration of use; any increase in the rate of diagnosis diminishes gradually during the 10 years after stopping and disappears by 10 years.</p>

                <h3>Cervical cancer</h3>
              <p>Use of combined oral contraceptives for 5 years or longer is associated with a small increased risk of cervical cancer; the risk diminishes after stopping and disappears by about 10 years. The risk of cervical cancer with transdermal patches is not yet known.</p><p>The possible small increase in the risk of breast cancer and cervical cancer should be weighed against the protective effect against cancers of the ovary and endometrium.</p>

            <p>There is an increased risk of venous thromboembolic disease in users of combined hormonal contraceptives particularly during the first year and possibly after restarting combined hormonal contraceptives following a break of four weeks or more. This risk is considerably smaller than that associated with pregnancy (about 60 cases of venous thromboembolic disease per 100&#8239;000 pregnancies). In all cases the risk of venous thromboembolism increases with age and in the presence of other risk factors, such as obesity. The risk also varies depending on the type of progestogen.</p><p>Provided that women are informed of the relative risks of venous thromboembolism and accept them, the choice of contraceptive is for the woman together with the prescriber jointly to make in light of her individual medical history and any contra-indications.</p><p>Combined hormonal contraceptives also slightly increase the risk of <i>arterial</i> thromboembolism; however, there is no evidence to suggest that this risk varies between different preparations. </p><fig>
