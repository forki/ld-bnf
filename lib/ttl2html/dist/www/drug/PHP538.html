              <p outputclass="title">Infliximab, adalimumab and golimumab for treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis after the failure of conventional therapy (February 2015)</p> <p>Infliximab is an option for treating moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis in adults whose disease has responded inadequately to conventional therapy including corticosteroids and mercaptopurine or azathioprine, or in adults who are intolerant to or have contra-indications for conventional therapies.</p> <p>The choice of treatment should be made on an individual basis and if more than one treatment is suitable, the least expensive should be chosen.</p> <p>Infliximab should be given as a planned course of treatment until treatment fails (including the need for surgery) or until 12 months after starting treatment, whichever is shorter. Treatment should be continued only if there is clear evidence of a response. Patients who continue treatment should be reassessed at least every 12 months to determine whether ongoing treatment is still clinically appropriate.</p><xref format="html" href="http://www.nice.org.uk/TA329">www.nice.org.uk/TA329</xref>

            predisposition to infection (discontinue if new serious infection develops)

            risk of delayed hypersensitivity reactions if drug-free interval exceeds 16 weeks

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Active tuberculosis should be treated with standard treatment for at least 2 months before starting infliximab. Patients who have previously received adequate treatment for tuberculosis can start infliximab but should be monitored every 3 months for possible recurrence. In patients without active tuberculosis but who were previously not treated adequately, chemoprophylaxis should ideally be completed before starting infliximab. In patients at high risk of tuberculosis who cannot be assessed by tuberculin skin test, chemoprophylaxis can be given concurrently with infliximab. </p>

          <li>
            <p>Hypersensitivity reactions (including fever, chest pain, hypotension, hypertension, dyspnoea, transient visual loss, pruritus, urticaria, serum sickness-like reactions, angioedema, anaphylaxis) reported during or within 1&#8211;2 hours after infusion (risk greatest during first or second infusion or in patients who discontinue other immunosuppressants). Prophylactic antipyretics, antihistamines, or hydrocortisone may be administered.</p>
