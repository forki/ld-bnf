Abrupt withdrawal after a prolonged period can lead to acute adrenal insufficiency, hypotension, or death.</p>\r\n<p>To compensate for a diminished adrenocortical response caused by prolonged corticosteroid treatment, any significant intercurrent illness, trauma, or surgical procedure requires a temporary increase in corticosteroid dose, or if already stopped, a temporary reintroduction of corticosteroid treatment. To avoid a precipitous fall in blood pressure during anaesthesia or in the immediate postoperative period, anaesthetists <b>must</b> know whether a patient is taking or has been taking a corticosteroid. A suitable regimen for corticosteroid replacement, in patients who have taken more than 10&#8239;mg prednisolone daily (or equivalent) within 3 months of surgery, is:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Minor surgery under general anaesthesia&#8212;usual oral corticosteroid dose on the morning of surgery or hydrocortisone (usually the sodium succinate) intravenously at induction; the usual oral corticosteroid dose is recommenced after surgery.</li>\r\n<li>Moderate or major surgery&#8212;usual oral corticosteroid dose on the morning of surgery and hydrocortisone intravenously at induction, followed by hydrocortisone 3 times a day by intravenous injection for 24 hours after moderate surgery or for 48&#8211;72 hours after major surgery; the usual pre-operative oral corticosteroid dose is recommenced on stopping hydrocortisone injections.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Patients on long-term corticosteroid treatment should carry a steroid treatment card which gives guidance on minimising risk and provides details of prescriber, drug, dosage and duration of treatment.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Infections</p>\r\n<p>Prolonged courses of corticosteroids increase susceptibility to infections and severity of infections; clinical presentation of infections may also be atypical. Serious infections e.g. <i>septicaemia</i> and <i>tuberculosis</i> may reach an advanced stage before being recognised, and <i>amoebiasis</i> or <i>strongyloidiasis</i> may be activated or exacerbated (exclude before initiating a corticosteroid in those at risk or with suggestive symptoms). Fungal or viral <i>ocular infections</i> may also be exacerbated.</p>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Chickenpox</p>\r\n<p>Unless they have had chickenpox, patients receiving oral or parenteral corticosteroids for purposes other than replacement should be regarded as being <i>at risk of severe chickenpox</i> (see Steroid Treatment Card). Manifestations of fulminant illness include pneumonia, hepatitis and disseminated intravascular coagulation; rash is not necessarily a prominent feature.</p>\r\n<p>Passive immunisation with varicella&#8211;zoster immunoglobulin is needed for exposed non&#8211;immune patients receiving systemic corticosteroids or for those who have used them within the previous 3 months. Confirmed chickenpox warrants specialist care and urgent treatment. Corticosteroids should not be stopped and dosage may need to be increased.</p>\r\n<p>Topical, inhaled or rectal corticosteroids are less likely to be associated with an increased risk of severe chickenpox.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Measles</p>\r\n<p>Patients taking corticosteroids should be advised to take particular care to avoid exposure to measles and to seek immediate medical advice if exposure occurs. Prophylaxis with intramuscular normal immunoglobulin may be needed.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</sectiondiv>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Psychiatric reactions</p>\r\n<p>Systemic corticosteroids, particularly in high doses, are linked to psychiatric reactions including euphoria, nightmares, insomnia, irritability, mood lability, suicidal thoughts, psychotic reactions, and behavioural disturbances. A serious paranoid state or depression with risk of suicide can be induced, particularly in patients with a history of mental disorder. These reactions frequently subside on reducing the dose or discontinuing the corticosteroid but they may also require specific management. Patients should be advised to seek medical advice if psychiatric symptoms (especially depression and suicidal thoughts) occur and they should also be alert to the rare possibility of such reactions during withdrawal of corticosteroid treatment.</p>\r\n<p>Systemic corticosteroids should be prescribed with care in those predisposed to psychiatric reactions, including those who have previously suffered corticosteroid&#8211;induced psychosis, or who have a personal or family history of psychiatric disorders.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\r\n\r\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP37491\" outputclass=\"pregnancy\" parent=\"/drug-classes/corticosteroids-systemic\">\n<title>Pregnancy</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>The benefit of treatment with corticosteroids during pregnancy outweighs the risk. Corticosteroid cover is required during labour.</p>\n<p>Following a review of the data on the safety of systemic corticosteroids used in pregnancy and breast-feeding the CSM (May 1998) concluded that corticosteroids vary in their ability to cross the placenta but there is no convincing evidence that systemic corticosteroids increase the incidence of congenital abnormalities such as cleft palate or lip. When administration is prolonged or repeated during pregnancy, systemic corticosteroids increase the risk of intra-uterine growth restriction; there is no evidence of intra-uterine growth restriction following short-term treatment (e.g. prophylactic treatment for neonatal respiratory distress syndrome).
