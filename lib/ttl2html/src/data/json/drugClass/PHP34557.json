Symptoms include agitation, irritability, ataxia, movement disorders, insomnia, drowsiness, vivid dreams, cognitive impairment, and slowed speech. Withdrawal symptoms occasionally experienced when discontinuing MAOIs include hallucinations and paranoid delusions. If possible MAOIs should be withdrawn slowly.</p>\n<p>Withdrawal effects may occur within 5 days of stopping treatment with antidepressant drugs; they are usually mild and self-limiting, but in some cases may be severe. The risk of withdrawal symptoms is increased if the antidepressant is stopped suddenly after regular administration for 8 weeks or more. The dose should preferably be reduced gradually over about 4 weeks, or longer if withdrawal symptoms emerge (6 months in patients who have been on long-term maintenance treatment).</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP69382\" outputclass=\"patientAndCarerAdvice\" rev=\"1.23\" parent=\"/drug-classes/monoamine-oxidase-inhibitors\">\n<title>Patient and carer advice</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"adviceAroundDrivingAndOtherTasks\">\n<title>Driving and skilled tasks</title>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Drowsiness may affect performance of skilled tasks (e.g. driving).</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n<section outputclass=\"patientResources\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>The patient information leaflet should be provided.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n<section outputclass=\"generalPatientAdvice\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Patients should be advised to eat only fresh foods and avoid food that is suspected of being stale or &#8216;going off&#8217;.
