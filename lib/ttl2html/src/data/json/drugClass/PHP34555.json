however, it has been reported more frequently with SSRIs than with other antidepressants. Hyponatraemia should be considered in all patients who develop drowsiness, confusion, or convulsions while taking an antidepressant.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Suicidal behaviour and antidepressant therapy</p>\r\n<p>The use of antidepressants has been linked with suicidal thoughts and behaviour; children, young adults, and patients with a history of suicidal behaviour are particularly at risk. Where necessary patients should be monitored for suicidal behaviour, self-harm, or hostility, particularly at the beginning of treatment or if the dose is changed.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Serotonin syndrome</p>\r\n<p>Serotonin syndrome or serotonin toxicity is a relatively uncommon adverse drug reaction caused by excessive central and peripheral serotonergic activity. Onset of symptoms, which range from mild to life-threatening, can occur within hours or days following the initiation, dose escalation, or overdose of a serotonergic drug, the addition of a new serotonergic drug, or the replacement of one serotonergic drug by another without allowing a long enough washout period in-between, particularly when the first drug is an irreversible MAOI or a drug with a long half-life. Severe toxicity, which is a medical emergency, usually occurs with a combination of serotonergic drugs, one of which is generally an MAOI.</p>\r\n<p>The characteristic symptoms of serotonin syndrome fall into 3 main areas, although features from each group may not be seen in all patients&#8212;neuromuscular hyperactivity (such as tremor, hyperreflexia, clonus, myoclonus, rigidity), autonomic dysfunction (tachycardia, blood pressure changes, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, diarrhoea), and altered mental state (agitation, confusion, mania).</p>\r\n<p>Treatment consists of withdrawal of the serotonergic medication and supportive care; specialist advice should be sought.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\r\n<section outputclass=\"sideEffectsOverdosageInformation\">\r\n<title>Overdose</title>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p>Symptoms of poisoning by selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors include nausea, vomiting, agitation, tremor, nystagmus, drowsiness, and sinus tachycardia; convulsions may occur. Rarely, severe poisoning results in the serotonin syndrome, with marked neuropsychiatric effects, neuromuscular hyperactivity, and autonomic instability; hyperthermia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, and coagulopathies may develop.</p>\r\n<p>For details on the management of poisoning, see Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, under <xref format=\"dita\" href=\"#PHP78558\" type=\"bookmark\" namespace=\"/treatment-summaries/emergency-treatment-of-poisoning\">Emergency treatment of poisoning</xref>.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\r\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP68931\" outputclass=\"pregnancy\" parent=\"/drug-classes/selective-serotonin-re-uptake-inhibitors\">\n<title>Pregnancy</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Manufacturers advise avoid during pregnancy unless the potential benefit outweighs the risk.

The dose should be tapered over at least a few weeks to avoid these effects. For some patients, it may be necessary to withdraw treatment over a longer period; consider obtaining specialist advice if symptoms persist.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Withdrawal effects may occur within 5 days of stopping treatment with antidepressant drugs; they are usually mild and self-limiting, but in some cases may be severe. The risk of withdrawal symptoms is increased if the antidepressant is stopped suddenly after regular administration for 8 weeks or more. The dose should preferably be reduced gradually over about 4 weeks, or longer if withdrawal symptoms emerge (6 months in patients who have been on long-term maintenance treatment).</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP68916\" outputclass=\"patientAndCarerAdvice\" rev=\"1.11\" parent=\"/drug-classes/selective-serotonin-re-uptake-inhibitors\">\n<title>Patient and carer advice</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"adviceAroundDrivingAndOtherTasks\">\n<title>Driving and skilled tasks</title>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>May also impair performance of skilled tasks (e.g. driving, operating machinery).</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<parents>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drugClasses\" href=\"#drugClasses\" title=\"Drug classes\" namespace=\"/drug-classes\">Drug classes</xref>\n</parents>\n<drugs>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2421\" title=\"CITALOPRAM\" namespace=\"/drugs/citalopram\">CITALOPRAM</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2424\" title=\"ESCITALOPRAM\" namespace=\"/drugs/escitalopram\">ESCITALOPRAM</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2426\" title=\"FLUOXETINE\" namespace=\"/drugs/fluoxetine\">FLUOXETINE</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2429\" title=\"FLUVOXAMINE MALEATE\" namespace=\"/drugs/fluvoxamine-maleate\">FLUVOXAMINE MALEATE</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2432\" title=\"PAROXETINE\" namespace=\"/drugs/paroxetine\">PAROXETINE</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2435\" title=\"SERTRALINE\" namespace=\"/drugs/sertraline\">SERTRALINE</xref>\n</drugs>\n<backlinks/>\n<links>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"treatmentSummary\" href=\"#PHP78558\" namespace=\"/treatment-summaries/emergency-treatment-of-poisoning\" title=\"Emergency treatment of poisoning\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">Emergency treatment of poisoning</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"#drugClasses\" href=\"#drugClasses\" namespace=\"/drug-classes\" title=\"Drug classes\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">Drug classes</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2421\" namespace=\"/drugs/citalopram\" title=\"CITALOPRAM\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">CITALOPRAM</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2424\" namespace=\"/drugs/escitalopram\" title=\"ESCITALOPRAM\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">ESCITALOPRAM</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2426\" namespace=\"/drugs/fluoxetine\" title=\"FLUOXETINE\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">FLUOXETINE</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2429\" namespace=\"/drugs/fluvoxamine-maleate\" title=\"FLUVOXAMINE MALEATE\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">FLUVOXAMINE MALEATE</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2432\" namespace=\"/drugs/paroxetine\" title=\"PAROXETINE\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">PAROXETINE</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drug\" href=\"#PHP2435\" namespace=\"/drugs/sertraline\" title=\"SERTRALINE\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">SERTRALINE</xref>\n</links>\n</topic>",
