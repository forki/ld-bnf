This risk is considerably smaller than that associated with pregnancy (about 60 cases of venous thromboembolic disease per 100&#8239;000 pregnancies). In all cases the risk of venous thromboembolism increases with age and in the presence of other risk factors, such as obesity. The risk also varies depending on the type of progestogen.</p>\n<p>Provided that women are informed of the relative risks of venous thromboembolism and accept them, the choice of contraceptive is for the woman together with the prescriber jointly to make in light of her individual medical history and any contra-indications.</p>\n<p>Combined hormonal contraceptives also slightly increase the risk of <i>arterial</i> thromboembolism;
