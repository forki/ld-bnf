Patients should be monitored for dyspnoea, persistent cough, chest pain, cardiac failure, and abdominal pain or tenderness. If long-term treatment is expected, then lung-function tests may also be helpful.

Patients and their carers should be informed about the risk of impulse control disorders. There is no evidence that ergot- and non-ergot-derived dopamine-receptor agonists differ in their propensity to cause impulse control disorders, so switching between dopamine-receptor agonists to control these side-effects is not recommended. If the patient develops an impulse control disorder, the dopamine-receptor agonist should be withdrawn or the dose reduced until the symptoms resolve.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP61662\" outputclass=\"contraindications\" rev=\"1.9\" parent=\"/drugs/cabergoline\">\n<title>Contra-indications</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"contraindications\">\n<p>\n<ph outputclass=\"contraindication\">Avoid in pre-eclampsia</ph>;
