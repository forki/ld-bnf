Ustekinumab is recommended only if the manufacturer provides the 90 mg dose of ustekinumab for patients who weigh more than 100 kg at the same cost as the 45 mg dose, as agreed in the patient access scheme. Ustekinumab treatment should be stopped if the patient's psoriatic arthritis has not shown an adequate response using the Psoriatic Arthritis Response Criteria (PsARC) at 24 weeks. Patients currently receiving ustekinumab whose disease does not meet the above criteria should have the option to continue treatment until they and their clinician consider it appropriate to stop.\n\nwww.nice.org.uk/TA340",
