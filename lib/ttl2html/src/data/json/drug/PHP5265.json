When high-dose therapy (e.g. more than 2&#8239;g intravenously) is used or when the patient is considered to be at high risk of cystitis (e.g. because of pelvic irradiation), mesna (given initially intravenously then by mouth) can also help prevent cystitis.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Secondary malignancy</p>\n<p>Prolonged use of alkylating drugs, particularly when combined with extensive irradiation, is associated with a marked increase in the incidence of acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP58767\" outputclass=\"conceptionAndContraception\" parent=\"/drugs/cyclophosphamide\">\n<title>Conception and contraception</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Exclude pregnancy before treatment with cytotoxic drugs.</p>\n<p>Contraceptive advice should be given to men and women before cytotoxic therapy begins; manufacturer advises effective contraception during and for at least 3 months after treatment in men or women.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Alkylating drugs often severely affect gametogenesis and carry the risk of causing permanent male sterility (there is no effect on potency).
