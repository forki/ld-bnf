this relative risk may be due to an earlier diagnosis. The most important risk factor appears to be the age at which the contraceptive is stopped rather than the duration of use; the risk disappears gradually during the 10 years after stopping and there is no excess risk by 10 years. A possible small increase in the risk of breast cancer should be weighed against the benefits.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP94697\" outputclass=\"pregnancy\" parent=\"/drugs/desogestrel\">\n<title>Pregnancy</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Not known to be harmful.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP94687\" outputclass=\"breastFeeding\" parent=\"/drugs/desogestrel\">\n<title>Breast feeding</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Progestogen-only contraceptives do not affect lactation.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP94694\" outputclass=\"hepaticImpairment\" parent=\"/drugs/desogestrel\">\n<title>Hepatic impairment</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Caution in severe liver disease and recurrent cholestatic jaundice.</p>\n<p>Avoid in liver tumour.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP94698\" outputclass=\"patientAndCarerAdvice\" rev=\"1.22\" parent=\"/drugs/desogestrel\">\n<title>Patient and carer advice</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"adviceAroundMissedDoses\">\n<title>Missed doses</title>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Missed pill</p>\n<p>The following advice is recommended: &#8216;If you forget a pill, take it as soon as you remember and carry on with the next pill at the right time.
