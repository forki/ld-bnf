They are reduced if low doses are given initially and then gradually increased, but this must be balanced against the need to obtain a full therapeutic effect as soon as possible.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Hyponatraemia and Antidepressant Therapy</p>\n<p>Hyponatraemia (usually in the elderly and possibly due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone) has been associated with all types of antidepressants; however, it has been reported more frequently with SSRIs than with other antidepressants. Hyponatraemia should be considered in all patients who develop drowsiness, confusion, or convulsions while taking an antidepressant.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Suicidal Behaviour</p>\n<p>The use of antidepressants has been linked with suicidal thoughts and behaviour; children, young adults, and patients with a history of suicidal behaviour are particularly at risk. Where necessary patients should be monitored for suicidal behaviour, self-harm, or hostility, particularly at the beginning of treatment or if the dose is changed.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n<section outputclass=\"sideEffectsOverdosageInformation\">\n<title>Overdose</title>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p> Tricyclic and related antidepressants cause dry mouth, coma of varying degree, hypotension, hypothermia, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, convulsions, respiratory failure, cardiac conduction defects, and arrhythmias. Dilated pupils and urinary retention also occur. Metabolic acidosis may complicate severe poisoning; delirium with confusion, agitation, and visual and auditory hallucinations are common during recovery.</p>\n<p>Assessment in hospital is strongly advised in case of poisoning by<i> tricyclic</i>\n<i>antidepressants</i> but symptomatic treatment can be given before transfer. Supportive measures to ensure a clear airway and adequate ventilation during transfer are mandatory. Intravenous lorazepam or intravenous diazepam (preferably in emulsion form) may be required to treat convulsions. Activated charcoal given within 1 hour of the overdose reduces absorption of the drug. Although arrhythmias are worrying, some will respond to correction of hypoxia and acidosis. The use of anti-arrhythmic drugs is best avoided, but intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate can arrest arrhythmias or prevent them in those with an extended QRS duration. Diazepam given by mouth is usually adequate to sedate delirious patients but large doses may be required.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Lofepramine is associated with the lowest risk of fatality in overdosage, in comparison with other tricyclic antidepressant drugs.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP54144\" outputclass=\"pregnancy\" parent=\"/drugs/lofepramine\">\n<title>Pregnancy</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Neonatal withdrawal symptoms and respiratory depression reported if used during third trimester.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP54477\" outputclass=\"breastFeeding\" parent=\"/drugs/lofepramine\">\n<title>Breast feeding</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>The amount secreted into breast milk is too small to be harmful.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP54272\" outputclass=\"hepaticImpairment\" parent=\"/drugs/lofepramine\">\n<title>Hepatic impairment</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Sedative effects are increased in hepatic impairment.</p>\n<p>Avoid in severe liver disease.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP54117\" outputclass=\"renalImpairment\" parent=\"/drugs/lofepramine\">\n<title>Renal impairment</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Avoid in severe impairment.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP54060\" outputclass=\"treatmentCessation\" rev=\"1.15\" parent=\"/drugs/lofepramine\">\n<title>Treatment cessation</title>\n<body>\n<section>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Withdrawal effects may occur within 5 days of stopping treatment with antidepressant drugs; they are usually mild and self-limiting, but in some cases may be severe.
