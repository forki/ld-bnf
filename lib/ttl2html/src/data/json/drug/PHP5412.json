Patients with neurotoxicity commonly have peripheral paraesthesia, loss of deep tendon reflexes, abdominal pain, and constipation; ototoxicity has been reported. If symptoms of neurotoxicity are severe, doses should be reduced.</p>\n<p>Motor weakness can also occur and dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy may be appropriate if motor weakness increases. Recovery from neurotoxic effects is usually slow but complete.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP46637\" outputclass=\"conceptionAndContraception\" parent=\"/drugs/vinblastine-sulfate\">\n<title>Conception and contraception</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Exclude pregnancy before treatment with cytotoxic drugs.</p>\n<p>Contraceptive advice should be given to men and women before cytotoxic therapy begins (and should cover the duration of contraception required after therapy has ended).</p>\n<p>Regimens that do not contain an alkylating drug or procarbazine may have less effect on fertility, but those with an alkylating drug or procarbazine carry the risk of causing permanent male sterility (there is no effect on potency). Pretreatment counselling and consideration of sperm storage may be appropriate. Women are less severely affected, though the span of reproductive life may be shortened by the onset of a premature menopause. No increase in fetal abnormalities or abortion rate has been recorded in patients who remain fertile after cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP46545\" outputclass=\"pregnancy\" parent=\"/drugs/vinblastine-sulfate\">\n<title>Pregnancy</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Avoid (limited experience suggests fetal harm; teratogenic in <i>animal</i> studies).</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Most cytotoxic drugs are teratogenic and should not be administered during pregnancy, especially during the first trimester.
