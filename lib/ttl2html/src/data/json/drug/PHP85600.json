This risk is considerably smaller than that associated with pregnancy (about 60 cases of venous thromboembolic disease per 100&#8239;000 pregnancies). In all cases the risk of venous thromboembolism increases with age and in the presence of other risk factors, such as obesity. The risk also varies depending on the type of progestogen.</p>\n<p>Provided that women are informed of the relative risks of venous thromboembolism and accept them, the choice of contraceptive is for the woman together with the prescriber jointly to make in light of her individual medical history and any contra-indications.</p>\n<p>Combined hormonal contraceptives also slightly increase the risk of <i>arterial</i> thromboembolism; however, there is no evidence to suggest that this risk varies between different preparations. </p>\n<fig>\n<title>Combined Hormonal Contraception and Risk of Venous Thromboembolism</title>\n<simpletable>\n<sthead>\n<stentry>Progestogen in Combined Hormonal Contraceptive</stentry>\n<stentry>Estimated incidence per 10,000 women per year of use</stentry>\n</sthead>\n<strow>\n<stentry>Non-pregnant, not using combined hormonal contraception</stentry>\n<stentry>2</stentry>\n</strow>\n<strow>\n<stentry>Levonorgesterol <sup>1</sup>\n</stentry>\n<stentry>5&#8211;7</stentry>\n</strow>\n<strow>\n<stentry>Norgestimate <sup>1</sup>\n</stentry>\n<stentry>5&#8211;7</stentry>\n</strow>\n<strow>\n<stentry>Norethisterone <sup>1</sup>\n</stentry>\n<stentry>5&#8211;7</stentry>\n</strow>\n<strow>\n<stentry>Etonogestrel <sup>1</sup>\n</stentry>\n<stentry>6&#8211;12</stentry>\n</strow>\n<strow>\n<stentry>Norelgestromin <sup>1</sup>\n</stentry>\n<stentry>6&#8211;12</stentry>\n</strow>\n<strow>\n<stentry>Gestodene <sup>1</sup>\n</stentry>\n<stentry>9&#8211;12</stentry>\n</strow>\n<strow>\n<stentry>Desogestrel <sup>1</sup>\n</stentry>\n<stentry>9&#8211;12</stentry>\n</strow>\n<strow>\n<stentry>Drospirenone <sup>1</sup>\n</stentry>\n<stentry>9&#8211;12</stentry>\n</strow>\n<strow>\n<stentry>Dienogest <sup>2</sup>\n</stentry>\n<stentry>Not known&#8212;insufficient data</stentry>\n</strow>\n<strow>\n<stentry>Nomegestrol <sup>2</sup>\n</stentry>\n<stentry>Not known&#8212;insufficient data</stentry>\n</strow>\n<strow outputclass=\"tfoot\">\n<stentry>\n<sup>1</sup>:-Combined with ethinylestradiol <sup>2</sup>:-Combined with estradiol</stentry>\n</strow>\n</simpletable>\n</fig>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Risk factors for venous thromboembolism</p>\n<p>Use with <b>caution</b> if any of following factors present but <b>avoid</b> if two or more factors present:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<i>family history of venous thromboembolism</i> in first-degree relative aged under 45 years (avoid if known prothrombotic coagulation abnormality e.g. factor V Leiden or antiphospholipid antibodies (including lupus anticoagulant));</li>\n<li>\n<i>obesity</i>&#8212;body mass index &#8805;
