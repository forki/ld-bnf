Hyponatraemia should be considered in all patients who develop drowsiness, confusion, or convulsions while taking an antidepressant.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Suicidal Behaviour</p>\n<p>The use of antidepressants has been linked with suicidal thoughts and behaviour; children, young adults, and patients with a history of suicidal behaviour are particularly at risk. Where necessary patients should be monitored for suicidal behaviour, self-harm, or hostility, particularly at the beginning of treatment or if the dose is changed.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n<section outputclass=\"sideEffectsOverdosageInformation\">\n<title>Overdose</title>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Emergency treatment of poisoning</p>\n<p>Tricyclic and related antidepressants cause dry mouth, coma of varying degree, hypotension, hypothermia, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar responses, convulsions, respiratory failure, cardiac conduction defects, and arrhythmias. Dilated pupils and urinary retention also occur. Metabolic acidosis may complicate severe poisoning; delirium with confusion, agitation, and visual and auditory hallucinations are common during recovery.</p>\n<p>Assessment in hospital is strongly advised in case of poisoning by <i>tricyclic</i>\n<i>antidepressants</i> but symptomatic treatment can be given before transfer. Supportive measures to ensure a clear airway and adequate ventilation during transfer are mandatory. Intravenous lorazepam or intravenous diazepam (preferably in emulsion form) may be required to treat convulsions. Activated charcoal given within 1 hour of the overdose reduces absorption of the drug. Although arrhythmias are worrying, some will respond to correction of hypoxia and acidosis. The use of anti-arrhythmic drugs is best avoided, but intravenous infusion of sodium bicarbonate can arrest arrhythmias or prevent them in those with an extended QRS duration. Diazepam given by mouth is usually adequate to sedate delirious patients but large doses may be required.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP66115\" outputclass=\"pregnancy\" parent=\"/drugs/imipramine-hydrochloride\">\n<title>Pregnancy</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Colic, tachycardia, dyspnoea, irritability, muscle spasms, respiratory depression and withdrawal symptoms reported in neonates when used in the third trimester.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP66217\" outputclass=\"breastFeeding\" parent=\"/drugs/imipramine-hydrochloride\">\n<title>Breast feeding</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>The amount secreted into breast milk is too small to be harmful.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP66171\" outputclass=\"hepaticImpairment\" parent=\"/drugs/imipramine-hydrochloride\">\n<title>Hepatic impairment</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Sedative effects are increased in hepatic impairment.</p>\n<p>Avoid in severe liver disease.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP66080\" outputclass=\"renalImpairment\" parent=\"/drugs/imipramine-hydrochloride\">\n<title>Renal impairment</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Use with caution in severe impairment.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP66019\" outputclass=\"treatmentCessation\" rev=\"1.14\" parent=\"/drugs/imipramine-hydrochloride\">\n<title>Treatment cessation</title>\n<body>\n<section>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Withdrawal effects may occur within 5 days of stopping treatment with antidepressant drugs; they are usually mild and self-limiting, but in some cases may be severe.
