During local outbreaks of influenza-like illness, when there is a high level of certainty that influenza is present, oseltamivir may be used for treatment in at-risk patients living in long-term residential or nursing homes. At risk patients include those aged over 65 years or those who have one or more of the following conditions: chronic respiratory disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); chronic heart disease; chronic renal disease; chronic liver disease; chronic neurological disease; immunosuppression; diabetes mellitus. The Department of Health in England has advised (November 2010 and April 2011) that &#8216;at risk patients&#8217; also includes patients under 65 years of age who are at risk of developing medical complications from influenza (treatment only) or women who are pregnant. This guidance does not cover the circumstances of a pandemic, an impending pandemic, or a widespread epidemic of a new strain of influenza to which there is little or no immunity in the community.\n\nwww.nice.org.uk/TA168",
