Effectiveness of the etonogestrel-releasing implant may be reduced by enzyme-inducing drugs and an alternative contraceptive method, unaffected by the interacting drug, is recommended during treatment with the enzyme-inducing drug and for at least 4 weeks after stopping. For a short course of an enzyme-inducing drug, if a change in contraceptive method is undesirable or inappropriate, the implant may be continued in combination with additional contraceptive precautions (e.g. condom) for the duration of treatment with the enzyme-inducing drug and for 4 weeks after stopping it.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP97290\" outputclass=\"sideEffects\" rev=\"1.17\" parent=\"/drugs/etonogestrel\">\n<title>Side-effects</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalSideEffects\">\n<sectiondiv outputclass=\"frequencies\">\n<sectiondiv outputclass=\"notKnown\">\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Frequency not known</p>\n<p outputclass=\"sideEffects\">\n<ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">Breast discomfort</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">changes in libido</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">depression</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">disturbance of appetite</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">dizziness</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">headache</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">injection-site reactions</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">menstrual irregularities</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">nausea</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">vomiting</ph>\n</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n<section outputclass=\"sideEffectsAdvice\">\n<title>Side-effects, further information</title>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Cervical cancer </p>\n<p>Use of injectable progestogen-only contraceptives may be associated with a small increased risk of cervical cancer, similar to that seen with combined oral contraceptives.

The most important risk factor appears to be the age at which the contraceptive is stopped rather than the duration of use; the risk disappears gradually during the 10 years after stopping and there is no excess risk by 10 years.
