Response to adalimumab treatment should be assessed at 12-week intervals and continued only if response is adequate. If response to treatment is not maintained, a repeat assessment should be made after a further 6 weeks and treatment discontinued if there is an inadequate response. Patients who are intolerant of adalimumab during the initial 12 weeks may receive etanercept.
