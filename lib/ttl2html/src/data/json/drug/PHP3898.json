When influenza is circulating in the community, zanamivir is an option recommended (in accordance with UK licensing) for the treatment of influenza in at-risk patients who can start treatment within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms. (National surveillance schemes, including those run by Public Health England, should be used to indicate when influenza is circulating in the community.) During local outbreaks of influenza-like illness, when there is a high level of certainty that influenza is present, zanamivir may be used for treatment in at-risk patients living in long-term residential or nursing homes. At risk patients are those who have one or more of the following conditions: chronic respiratory disease (including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); chronic heart disease; chronic renal disease; chronic liver disease; chronic neurological disease; immunosuppression; diabetes mellitus. The Department of Health in England has advised (November 2010 and April 2011) that &#8216;at risk patients&#8217; also includes children who are at risk of developing medical complications from influenza (treatment only) or females who are pregnant. This guidance does not cover the circumstances of a pandemic, an impending pandemic, or a widespread epidemic of a new strain of influenza to which there is little or no immunity in the community.\n\nwww.nice.org.uk/TA168",
