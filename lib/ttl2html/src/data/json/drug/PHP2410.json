Symptoms include agitation, irritability, ataxia, movement disorders, insomnia, drowsiness, vivid dreams, cognitive impairment, and slowed speech. Withdrawal symptoms occasionally experienced when discontinuing MAOIs include hallucinations and paranoid delusions. If possible MAOIs should be withdrawn slowly.</p>\n<p>Withdrawal effects may occur within 5 days of stopping treatment with antidepressant drugs; they are usually mild and self-limiting, but in some cases may be severe. The risk of withdrawal symptoms is increased if the antidepressant is stopped suddenly after regular administration for 8 weeks or more. The dose should preferably be reduced gradually over about 4 weeks, or longer if withdrawal symptoms emerge (6 months in patients who have been on long-term maintenance treatment).</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP46716\" outputclass=\"patientAndCarerAdvice\" rev=\"1.18\" parent=\"/drugs/moclobemide\">\n<title>Patient and carer advice</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"patientResources\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Patients or carers should be given a patient information leaflet.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n<section outputclass=\"generalPatientAdvice\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Moclobemide is claimed to cause less potentiation of the pressor effect of tyramine than the traditional (irreversible) MAOIs, but patients should avoid consuming large amounts of tyramine-rich food (such as mature cheese, yeast extracts and fermented soya bean products).</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP2410-medicinalForms\" outputclass=\"medicinalForms\" parent=\"/drugs/moclobemide\">\n<title>Medicinal forms</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"licensingVariationStatement\">\n<p>There can be variation in the licensing of different medicines containing the same drug.</p>\n</section>\n<p>Forms available from special-order manufacturers include: oral suspension</p>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<parents>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drugs\" href=\"#drugs\" title=\"Drugs\" namespace=\"/drugs\">Drugs</xref>\n</parents>\n<children>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"medicinalForm\" href=\"#PHP77933\" title=\"Tablet\" namespace=\"/drugs/moclobemide/tablet\">Tablet</xref>\n</children>\n<backlinks>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drugClassifications\" href=\"#PHP106980\" namespace=\"/drug-classifications\" title=\"Drug classifications\" count=\"1\" rel=\"backlink\">Drug classifications</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"treatmentSummary\" href=\"#PHP78258\" namespace=\"/treatment-summaries/antidepressant-drugs\" title=\"Antidepressant drugs\" count=\"3\" rel=\"backlink\">Antidepressant drugs</xref>\n</backlinks>\n<links>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"interaction\" href=\"#bnf_int_262\" namespace=\"/interactions/list-of-drug-interactions/antidepressants/maois-reversible/moclobemide\" title=\"Moclobemide\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">Moclobemide</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"#drugs\" href=\"#drugs\" namespace=\"/drugs\" title=\"Drugs\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">Drugs</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"medicinalForm\" href=\"#PHP77933\" namespace=\"/drugs/moclobemide/tablet\" title=\"Tablet\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">Tablet</xref>\n</links>\n</topic>",
