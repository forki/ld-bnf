Treatment should be continued only if there is clear evidence of a response. Patients who continue treatment should be reassessed at least every 12 months to determine whether ongoing treatment is still clinically appropriate.</p><xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.nice.org.uk/TA329\">www.nice.org.uk/TA329</xref>"
