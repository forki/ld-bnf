This applies especially to drugs with sedative effects; patients should be warned that these effects are increased by alcohol. General information about a patient's fitness to drive is available from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency at<xref format=\"html\" href=\"http://www.dvla.gov.uk\">www.dvla.gov.uk</xref>. </p>\r\n<p>A new offence of driving, attempting to drive, or being in charge of a vehicle, with certain specified controlled drugs in excess of specified limits, came into force on 2<sup>nd</sup> March 2015. This offence is an addition to the existing rules on drug impaired driving and fitness to drive and applies to two groups of drugs&#8212;commonly abused drugs, including cannabis, cocaine, and ketamine, and drugs used mainly for medical reasons, such as opioids and benzodiazepines. Amfetamines are also expected to be added to the legislation later in 2015. Anyone found to have any of the drugs (including related drugs, for example, apomorphine) above specified limits in their blood will be guilty of an offence, whether their driving was impaired or not. This also includes prescribed drugs which metabolise to those included in the offence, for example, selegiline. However, the legislation provides a statutory &#8220;medical defence&#8221; for patients taking drugs for medical reasons in accordance with instructions, if their driving was not impaired&#8212; it continues to be an offence to drive if actually impaired. Patients should therefore be advised to continue taking their medicines as prescribed, and when driving, to carry suitable evidence that the drug was prescribed, or sold, to treat a medical or dental problem, and that it was taken according to the instructions given by the prescriber, or information provided with the medicine (e.g. a repeat prescription form or the medicine&#8217;s patient information leaflet).
