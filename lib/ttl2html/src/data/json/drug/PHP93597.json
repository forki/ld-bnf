Mild to moderate infusion-related reactions may improve by temporarily reducing the rate or stopping the infusion. When restarting treatment, a reduced infusion rate and the administration of antihistamines, paracetamol, and corticosteroids should be considered. Consider discontinuation of siltuximab if more than 2 doses are delayed due to treatment-related toxicities during the first 48 weeks&#8212;for full details consult product literature.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP93933\" outputclass=\"conceptionAndContraception\" parent=\"/drugs/siltuximab\">\n<title>Conception and contraception</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Women of childbearing potential should use effective contraception during and for 3 months after treatment.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP93941\" outputclass=\"pregnancy\" parent=\"/drugs/siltuximab\">\n<title>Pregnancy</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Manufacturer advises avoid unless potential benefit outweighs risk.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP93931\" outputclass=\"breastFeeding\" parent=\"/drugs/siltuximab\">\n<title>Breast feeding</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Manufacturer advises avoid&#8212;no information available.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP93938\" outputclass=\"hepaticImpairment\" parent=\"/drugs/siltuximab\">\n<title>Hepatic impairment</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Use with caution in hepatic impairment.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP93949\" outputclass=\"monitoringRequirements\" parent=\"/drugs/siltuximab\">\n<title>Monitoring requirements</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"monitoringOfPatientParameters\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Monitor neutrophil and platelet count, and haemoglobin levels prior to each dose of siltuximab treatment for the first 12 months and thereafter prior to every third dosing cycle.
