The increased risk is related to the duration of HRT use (but not to the age at which HRT is started) and this excess risk disappears within 5 years of stopping.</p>\r\n<p>Radiological detection of breast cancer can be made more difficult as mammographic density can increase with HRT use.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Risk of endometrial cancer</p>\r\n<p>The increased risk of endometrial cancer depends on the dose and duration of oestrogen-only HRT.</p>\r\n<p>In women with a uterus, the addition of a progestogen cyclically (for at least 10 days per 28-day cycle) reduces the additional risk of endometrial cancer; this additional risk is eliminated if a progestogen is given continuously. However, this should be weighed against the increased risk of breast cancer.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Risk of ovarian cancer</p>\r\n<p>Long-term use of combined HRT or oestrogen-only HRT is associated with a small increased risk of ovarian cancer. This excess risk disappears within a few years of stopping.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Risk of venous thromboembolism</p>\r\n<p>Women using combined or oestrogen-only HRT are at an increased risk of deep vein thrombosis and of pulmonary embolism especially in the first year of use.</p>\r\n<p>In <i>women who have predisposing factors</i> (such as a personal or family history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, severe varicose veins, obesity, trauma, or prolonged bed-rest) it is prudent to review the need for HRT, as in some cases the risks of HRT may exceed the benefits.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<i>Travel</i> involving prolonged immobility further increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Risk of stroke</p>\r\n<p>Risk of stroke increases with age, therefore older women have a greater absolute risk of stroke. Combined HRT or oestrogen-only HRT slightly increases the risk of stroke.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Risk of coronary heart disease</p>\r\n<p>HRT does not prevent coronary heart disease and should not be prescribed for this purpose. There is an increased risk of coronary heart disease in women who start combined HRT more than 10 years after menopause. Although very little information is available on the risk of coronary heart disease in younger women who start HRT close to the menopause, studies suggest a lower relative risk compared with older women.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\r\n<sectiondiv>\r\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Other conditions</p>\r\n<p>The product literature advises caution in other conditions including hypertension, renal disease, asthma, epilepsy, sickle-cell disease, melanoma, otosclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (but care required if antiphospholipid antibodies present). Evidence for caution in these conditions is unsatisfactory and many women with these conditions may stand to benefit from HRT.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP94750\" outputclass=\"interactions\" rev=\"1.8\" parent=\"/drugs/estriol\">\n<title>Interactions</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"general\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Appendix 1 (oestrogens).</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP94755\" outputclass=\"sideEffects\" rev=\"1.17\" parent=\"/drugs/estriol\">\n<title>Side-effects</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalSideEffects\">\n<title>General side-effects:</title>\n<sectiondiv outputclass=\"frequencies\">\n<sectiondiv outputclass=\"notKnown\">\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Frequency not known</p>\n<p outputclass=\"sideEffects\">\n<ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">Abdominal bloating</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">abdominal cramps</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">altered blood lipids (may lead to pancreatitis, rashes and chloasma)</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">breast enlargement</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">breast tenderness</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">changes in libido</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">cholestatic jaundice</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">contact lenses may irritate</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">depression</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">dizziness</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">fluid retention</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">glucose intolerance</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">headache</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">leg cramps</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">migraine</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">mood changes</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">nausea</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">premenstrual-like syndrome</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">sodium retention</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">vaginal candidiasis</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">vomiting</ph>; <ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">weight changes</ph>\n</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n<section outputclass=\"specificSideEffects\">\n<title>Specific side-effects:</title>\n<sectiondiv outputclass=\"frequencies\">\n<sectiondiv outputclass=\"notKnown\">\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Frequency not known</p>\n<sectiondiv outputclass=\"sideEffectsWithRoutes\">\n<p outputclass=\"title\">With vaginal use</p>\n<p>\n<ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">local irritation</ph>\n</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</sectiondiv>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n<section outputclass=\"sideEffectsAdvice\">\n<title>Side-effects, further information</title>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Leg Cramps</p>\n<p>Venous thrombosis should be ruled out.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Withdrawal Bleeding</p>\n<p>Cyclical HRT (where a progestogen is taken for 12&#8211;14 days of each 28-day oestrogen treatment cycle) usually results in <i>regular withdrawal bleeding</i> towards the end of the progestogen.
