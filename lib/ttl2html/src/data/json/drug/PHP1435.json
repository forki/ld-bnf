Great care should be taken to avoid inadvertent intravenous administration of a preparation containing adrenaline, and it is not advisable to give adrenaline with a local anaesthetic injection in digits or appendages because of the risk of ischaemic necrosis.\n\nAdrenaline must be used in a low concentration when administered with a local anaesthetic. The total dose of adrenaline should not exceed 5 micrograms/kg (1 mL/kg of a 1 in 200 000 solution) and it is essential not to exceed a concentration of 1 in 200 000 (5 micrograms/mL) if more than 50 mL of the mixture is to be injected. Care must also be taken to calculate a safe maximum dose of local anaesthetic when using combination products.\n\nIn children with severe hypertension or unstable cardiac rhythm, the use of adrenaline with a local anaesthetic may be hazardous. For these children an anaesthetic without adrenaline should be used.",
