TNF-&#945; inhibitors should be given in combination with methotrexate; however, when methotrexate cannot be used because of intolerance or contra-indications, etanercept can be given as monotherapy. Etanercept should be withdrawn if response is not adequate within 6 months. Response to treatment should be monitored at least every 6 months in patients who respond initially; treatment should be withdrawn if response is not maintained. An alternative TNF-&#945; inhibitor may be considered for patients in whom treatment is withdrawn because of intolerance before the initial 6-month assessment of efficacy.
