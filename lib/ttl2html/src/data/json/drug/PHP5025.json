If the copper intra-uterine device is undesirable or inappropriate, the dose of levonorgestrel should be increased to a total of 3&#8239;mg taken as a single dose [unlicensed dose&#8212;advise women accordingly]. There is no need to increase the dose for emergency contraception if the patient is taking antibacterials that are not enzyme inducers.</p>\n<p>With the progestogen-only intra-uterine device, levonorgestrel is released close to the site of the main contraceptive action (on cervical mucus and endometrium) and therefore progestogenic side-effects and interactions are less likely; in particular, enzyme-inducing drugs are unlikley to significantly reduce the contraceptive effect of the progestogen-only intra-uterine system and additional contraceptive precautions are not required.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP72758\" outputclass=\"sideEffects\" rev=\"1.78\" parent=\"/drugs/levonorgestrel\">\n<title>Side-effects</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalSideEffects\">\n<title>General side-effects:</title>\n<sectiondiv outputclass=\"frequencies\">\n<sectiondiv outputclass=\"commonOrVeryCommon\">\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Common or very common</p>\n<p outputclass=\"sideEffects\">\n<ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">Depression (sometimes severe)</ph>;
