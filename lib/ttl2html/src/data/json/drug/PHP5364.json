Pretreatment counselling and consideration of sperm storage may be appropriate. Women are less severely affected, though the span of reproductive life may be shortened by the onset of a premature menopause. No increase in fetal abnormalities or abortion rate has been recorded in patients who remain fertile after cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP65642\" outputclass=\"pregnancy\" parent=\"/drugs/cladribine\">\n<title>Pregnancy</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Avoid (teratogenic in <i>animal</i> studies).</p>\n<p>Considerable caution is necessary if a pregnant woman presents with cancer requiring chemotherapy, and specialist advice should always be sought.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP65787\" outputclass=\"breastFeeding\" parent=\"/drugs/cladribine\">\n<title>Breast feeding</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalInformation\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Discontinue breast-feeding.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP65820\" outputclass=\"directionsForAdministration\" rev=\"1.11\" parent=\"/drugs/cladribine\">\n<title>Directions for administration</title>\n<body>\n<section>\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>\n<i>Litak</i>\n<tm tmtype=\"reg\"/> for subcutaneous use only&#8212;no dilution required.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP5364-medicinalForms\" outputclass=\"medicinalForms\" parent=\"/drugs/cladribine\">\n<title>Medicinal forms</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"licensingVariationStatement\">\n<p>There can be variation in the licensing of different medicines containing the same drug.</p>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<parents>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drugs\" href=\"#drugs\" title=\"Drugs\" namespace=\"/drugs\">Drugs</xref>\n</parents>\n<children>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"medicinalForm\" href=\"#PHP76140\" title=\"Solution for injection\" namespace=\"/drugs/cladribine/solution-for-injection\">Solution for injection</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"medicinalForm\" href=\"#PHP76133\" title=\"Solution for infusion\" namespace=\"/drugs/cladribine/solution-for-infusion\">Solution for infusion</xref>\n</children>\n<backlinks>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"drugClassifications\" href=\"#PHP106980\" namespace=\"/drug-classifications\" title=\"Drug classifications\" count=\"1\" rel=\"backlink\">Drug classifications</xref>\n</backlinks>\n<links>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"interaction\" href=\"#bnf_int_1257\" namespace=\"/interactions/list-of-drug-interactions/cytotoxics/antimetabolites/cladribine\" title=\"Cladribine\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">Cladribine</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"#drugs\" href=\"#drugs\" namespace=\"/drugs\" title=\"Drugs\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">Drugs</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"medicinalForm\" href=\"#PHP76140\" namespace=\"/drugs/cladribine/solution-for-injection\" title=\"Solution for injection\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">Solution for injection</xref>\n<xref format=\"dita\" scope=\"local\" type=\"medicinalForm\" href=\"#PHP76133\" namespace=\"/drugs/cladribine/solution-for-infusion\" title=\"Solution for infusion\" count=\"1\" rel=\"link\">Solution for infusion</xref>\n</links>\n</topic>",
