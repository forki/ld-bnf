Abnormal dreams, insomnia, anxiety, and depression occur commonly. Psychosis, suicidal ideation, and suicide have also been reported. Psychiatric symptoms such as nightmares, acute anxiety, depression, restlessness, or confusion should be regarded as potentially prodromal for a more serious event. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, patients should be advised to discontinue mefloquine and to seek immediate medical attention so that mefloquine can be replaced with an alternative antimalarial. Adverse reactions may occur and persist up to several months after discontinuation because mefloquine has a long half-life. Mefloquine is contraindicated for malaria prophylaxis in those with a history of psychiatric disorders or convulsions.</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP38444\" outputclass=\"interactions\" rev=\"1.7\" parent=\"/drugs/mefloquine\">\n<title>Interactions</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"general\">\n<sectiondiv>\n<p>Appendix 1 (mefloquine).</p>\n</sectiondiv>\n</section>\n</body>\n</topic>\n<topic id=\"PHP38268\" outputclass=\"sideEffects\" rev=\"1.21\" parent=\"/drugs/mefloquine\">\n<title>Side-effects</title>\n<body>\n<section outputclass=\"generalSideEffects\">\n<sectiondiv outputclass=\"frequencies\">\n<sectiondiv outputclass=\"commonOrVeryCommon\">\n<p outputclass=\"title\">Common or very common</p>\n<p outputclass=\"sideEffects\">\n<ph outputclass=\"sideEffect\">Abdominal pain</ph>;

Psychiatric symptoms such as nightmares, acute anxiety, depression, restlessness, or confusion should be regarded as potentially prodromal for a more serious event. If neuropsychiatric symptoms occur, patients should be advised to discontinue mefloquine and to seek immediate medical attention so that mefloquine can be replaced with an alternative antimalarial. Adverse reactions may occur and persist up to several months after discontinuation because mefloquine has a long half-life.
